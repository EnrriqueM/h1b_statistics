# Problem

A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesnâ€™t have them for past years. 

This program calculates two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.

# Input Dataset

Used the Excel files found in this Google drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nti6ClUfibsXSQw5PUIWfVGSIrpuwyxf?usp=sharing).


# Instructions

This code was written using C++. To start using, run the 'run.sh' file in the command line. The program will anaylze the file 'H1B_FY_2014.csv' by default. This script takes an optional argument of a location of a file desired to be anaylze. If you want to anaylze a different file, the file mst be in the input file and add the argument: './input/<filename>'

# Output 

This program creates 2 output files:
* `top_10_occupations.txt`: Top 10 occupations for certified visa applications
* `top_10_states.txt`: Top 10 states for certified visa applications

Each line holds one record and each field on each line is separated by a semicolon (;).

Each line of the `top_10_occupations.txt` file contains these fields in this order:
1. __`TOP_OCCUPATIONS`__: Use the occupation name associated with an application's Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code
2. __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__: Number of applications that have been certified for that occupation. An application is considered certified if it has a case status of `Certified`
3. __`PERCENTAGE`__: % of applications that have been certified for that occupation compared to total number of certified applications regardless of occupation. 

Each line of the `top_10_states.txt` file contains these fields in this order:
1. __`TOP_STATES`__: State where the work will take place
2. __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__: Number of applications that have been certified for work in that state. An application is considered certified if it has a case status of `Certified`
3. __`PERCENTAGE`__: % of applications that have been certified in that state compared to total number of certified applications regardless of state.

Depending on the input (e.g., see the example below), there may be fewer than 10 lines in each file. There, however, should not be more than 10 lines in each file. In case of ties, only list the top 10 based on the sorting instructions given above.
